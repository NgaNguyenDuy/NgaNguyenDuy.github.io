00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,780
Give us ten minutes.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,860
We'll give you an explanation of world events.

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,420
I'm Carl Azuz for CNN STUDENT NEWS.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,260
First up this Thursday, struggles in France.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,760
Authorities there have cleared out "The Jungle",

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,240
the nickname for a massive migrant and refugee camp that had swelled in the French port city of Calais.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,220
Many of the people there were from war-torn violent or impoverished countries.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,800
They've streamed by the hundreds of thousands into Europe,

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
and "The Jungle" formed because Calais is just miles from Britain,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,660
the country where many of the migrants want to start over.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,240
But European Union rules say they have to apply for asylum

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,660
to stay in the first European country where they set off.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,560
So, authorities in France are trying to resettle them there.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,120
Part of that process involves clearing out camps like "The Jungle",

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,680
where living conditions were terrible and French officials say crime rates were uncontrollable.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,480
But other camps are growing in several other places,

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,000
like parts of Paris.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,740
And though French law says migrants are eligible for housing

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,120
while they're waiting to see if they can legally stay in France,

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,040
there's a serious shortage of housing in Paris.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,560
With more migrants arriving daily,

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,820
the strain in the city becomes more visible.

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,420
[ BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ]

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,100
The Calais jungle is now a thing of the past.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,600
Its tents torn down and its inhabitants relocated to emergency shelters in France`s regions.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,720
But as the camp in Calais has closed,

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,420
others have grown,

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,060
like this one near a Paris metro station.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,460
As we know the Paris are opening the door.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,640
There are rumors in the whole Europe that France is giving the papers,

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,180
so all of them are coming toward France right now.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,120
The number of migrants living around Stalingrad station have swelled

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,540
over the course of the last couple of weeks from several hundred to two and a half thousand,

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,920
according to the aid associations who helped them.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,260
We're talking about Eritreans, Somalis,

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,940
Sudanese and Afghan nationals,

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,740
most of whom have applied for asylum here in France.

39
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,260
They're simply waiting now for their applications to be processed

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,540
and living in the meantime in the most appalling conditions.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,320
Sara (ph) is just 17 years old.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,860
She arrived at the Stalingrad camp a week ago.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
And she says she`s had no help in claiming asylum.

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,020
It's very cold, someone is drinking,

45
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,100
they talking together.

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,440
How we can sleep?

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,500
So when I sleep in the night I cry.

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,460
Always I can cry.

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,940
How I can sleep?

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,680
Are you scared?

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,560
I worry myself, I don't have anybody there.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Soon, migrants arriving in Paris will be taken to this camp in the north of the city.

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,180
It was due to open in November and it shouldn't be long,

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,200
say authorities, after Calais,

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
they want migrants off all of France's streets.

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Stalingrad is to be cleared by the end of the week.

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,560
Its tents torn down and its inhabitants relocated to emergency shelters in the greater Paris region.

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,960
The question is,

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,900
how many more will be drawn to the streets of a country that now appears to be offering than just its streets?

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,540
Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

61
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,660
With eight justices and one vacancy,

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,180
the U.S. Supreme Court is about a month into its newest session.

63
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,960
It will probably run until the beginning of next summer.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,280
The high court has taken up a pretty wide range of cases.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,840
One involves whether the stripes and badges of a cheerleading outfit can be protected by copyright.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,640
One involves alleged racial bias by a juror in a case in Colorado.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,980
One involves money that the Apple technology won

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,100
in a caseinvolving a patent dispute with the Samsung tech company.

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
There's a lot for justices to consider in these cases alone,

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,920
but it begs the question,

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,100
how do they get on a docket in the first place with so many lawsuits playing out across the country?

72
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,400
[ BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ]

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,760
For the Supreme Court,

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,040
the big issue is often what cases they hear as much as how they decide those cases.

75
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,560
The justices get thousands of petitions every year,

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,400
asking them to hear cases.

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,140
But they only agree to decide about 70 of those cases.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,100
The main reason the justices take a case is what`s known as a split in the circuits.

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,060
There are 13 circuit courts of appeals, and sometimes,

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,920
two of those circuits address the same issue and come out differently.

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
In almost all those cases,

82
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,580
the Supreme Court agrees to decide the case.

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Now, what kind of cases do they take?

84
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,120
The Supreme Court only deals with federal law.

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,080
So, they will only decide cases that involve interpreting federal laws or

86
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,000
cases that involve the U.S. constitution which is the ultimate law of the land.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,180
Sometimes the justices do what's called strategic voting.

88
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,900
They think, you know, I think this lower court decision is wrong.

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,940
But if I vote to hear this case, my colleagues will make the law even worse.

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,820
So, I'm going to vote to leave the case alone rather than risking a bad Supreme Court decision

91
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,160
that could last for decades.

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,300
We often hear about 5-4 Supreme Court decisions.

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,020
But it's always worth remembering

94
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,720
that it only takes four justices

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,380
to make the most important decision of all, which is to hear the case in the first place.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,620
Farming the wind. America's first offshore wind farm is about to open.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,720
These large turbines will be located about three miles off the coast of Block Island,

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,300
which is south of Rhode Island.

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,560
The cost to build the project, $300 million.

100
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,220
These turbines are huge, almost 600 feet tall from the bottom to the tip top of the fan blade.

101
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
It took a while for people to get behind this project.

102
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,960
Some fishermen were concerned about the impact on their industry.

103
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,180
The Kennedys, a prominent American political family,

104
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,700
were concerned about how the turbines would look.

105
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,060
You can see some offshore wind farms from the beach.

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,920
Most of the world's offshore turbines are in Europe.

107
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,820
Leases for the American ones were issued by the Department of the Interior,

108
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
which oversees U.S. land management and conservation.

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,560
These turbines will start whirring this month

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,960
and their developer estimates they`ll reduce Block Island's electric rates by 40 percent.

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,780
Well, we are five days away from the election that will determine America's next president.

112
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,060
Election Day is Tuesday, November 8th.

113
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,620
And the latest polls suggest it could be a very close race

114
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,460
between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,540
The CIA world fact book describes America's government type not as a democracy,

116
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,120
but as a federal presidential republic. U.S. voters do not directly choose their leaders.

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,360
They choose a group of electors who actually determine the president.

118
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,640
This group is called the Electoral College,

119
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,020
and while you heard it defined and seen the Electoral College map,

120
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,540
how exactly does the system work?

121
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,140
What is the Electoral College?

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,980
The Electoral College is not a building or institution,

123
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,260
it's just a name given to a designated group of people who cast each state's official votes for president.

124
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,900
This group is made up of 538 people.

125
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,180
Each state has a different number of electors based on their representatives in Congress.

126
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,820
So, states like California and Texas have more votes than states like North and South Dakota.

127
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,520
The only exception, the District of Columbia,

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,280
which has three electors, despite not having any voting members in Congress.

129
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
How does it work?

130
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Each party selects their own group of electors

131
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,780
and state that empowers the electors who represent the candidate who won the most votes.

132
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,020
Except Nebraska and Maine forward electors based on a combination of statewide results and districts won.

133
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,940
The candidate who receives at least 270 Electoral College votes becomes the next president.

134
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,020
What if there's a tie?

135
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,660
If there is a tie or if somebody doesn't get to 270,

136
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,700
the House of Representatives appoint the president and the Senate chooses the vice president.

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,960
Why does the system exist?

138
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,920
In short,

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,100
the Electoral College was created as a compromise of a several different proposals by the nation's founders.

140
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,560
Critics say the system allows candidates to become president without necessarily securing a majority of voter support,

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,420
which happened in 2000.

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,240
Advocates argue, it ensures less populated states aren't completely ignored.

143
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,500
How are these people selected?

144
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,040
The electors are chosen by their political parties in each state.

145
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
The only rule is that they cannot currently hold office.

146
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,660
Can an elector ignore the popular vote?

147
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes, it's called faithless elector,

148
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,900
but it's rare and it has never affected the outcome of an election.

149
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,200
Some states require formal pledges,

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,020
enforced by fines and possible jail time.

151
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,100
But historically speaking,

152
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,800
members rarely depart from the will of the people.

153
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,460
Students at the University of Oregon had a really cool idea of how to dispose of pumpkins.

154
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,320
Step one, freeze them in liquid nitrogen,

155
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,960
step two, drop 'em from four stories up.

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,480
Bam!

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,400
The hypothesis was that once these gourds were chilled to a temperature of negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit,

158
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
they'd shatter on impact.

159
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,040
Good call, y'all.

160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,480
Plus, while it may not be pumpkin pie,

161
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,320
pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin spice or pumpkin cookies,

162
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,700
it's clear they had a blast breaking pumpkin glass.

163
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,440
It might put a chill on your bones to have to clean up all that frozen fruit,

164
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,420
but they had a vine time making it,

165
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,780
stem from a really gourd idea, and if it grows on enough people,

166
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,220
it could entertain nitrogenerations.
