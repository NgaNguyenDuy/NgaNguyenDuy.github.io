00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.780
Give us ten minutes.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.860
We'll give you an explanation of world events.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm Carl Azuz for CNN STUDENT NEWS.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.260
First up this Thursday, struggles in France.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.760
Authorities there have cleared out "The Jungle",

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.240
the nickname for a massive migrant and refugee camp that had swelled in the French port city of Calais.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.220
Many of the people there were from war-torn violent or impoverished countries.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.800
They've streamed by the hundreds of thousands into Europe,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.480
and "The Jungle" formed because Calais is just miles from Britain,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.660
the country where many of the migrants want to start over.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.240
But European Union rules say they have to apply for asylum

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.660
to stay in the first European country where they set off.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.560
So, authorities in France are trying to resettle them there.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.120
Part of that process involves clearing out camps like "The Jungle",

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.680
where living conditions were terrible and French officials say crime rates were uncontrollable.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.480
But other camps are growing in several other places,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.000
like parts of Paris.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
And though French law says migrants are eligible for housing

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120
while they're waiting to see if they can legally stay in France,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.040
there's a serious shortage of housing in Paris.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.560
With more migrants arriving daily,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.820
the strain in the city becomes more visible.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.420
[ BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ]

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.100
The Calais jungle is now a thing of the past.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.600
Its tents torn down and its inhabitants relocated to emergency shelters in France`s regions.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.720
But as the camp in Calais has closed,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.420
others have grown,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.060
like this one near a Paris metro station.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.460
As we know the Paris are opening the door.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.640
There are rumors in the whole Europe that France is giving the papers,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.180
so all of them are coming toward France right now.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.120
The number of migrants living around Stalingrad station have swelled

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.540
over the course of the last couple of weeks from several hundred to two and a half thousand,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.920
according to the aid associations who helped them.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.260
We're talking about Eritreans, Somalis,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.940
Sudanese and Afghan nationals,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.740
most of whom have applied for asylum here in France.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.260
They're simply waiting now for their applications to be processed

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.540
and living in the meantime in the most appalling conditions.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.320
Sara (ph) is just 17 years old.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.860
She arrived at the Stalingrad camp a week ago.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.440
And she says she`s had no help in claiming asylum.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.020
It's very cold, someone is drinking,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.100
they talking together.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.440
How we can sleep?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.500
So when I sleep in the night I cry.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.460
Always I can cry.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.940
How I can sleep?

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.680
Are you scared?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.560
I worry myself, I don't have anybody there.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
Soon, migrants arriving in Paris will be taken to this camp in the north of the city.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.180
It was due to open in November and it shouldn't be long,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.200
say authorities, after Calais,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.400
they want migrants off all of France's streets.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.400
Stalingrad is to be cleared by the end of the week.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.560
Its tents torn down and its inhabitants relocated to emergency shelters in the greater Paris region.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.960
The question is,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.900
how many more will be drawn to the streets of a country that now appears to be offering than just its streets?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.540
Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.660
With eight justices and one vacancy,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.180
the U.S. Supreme Court is about a month into its newest session.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.960
It will probably run until the beginning of next summer.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.280
The high court has taken up a pretty wide range of cases.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.840
One involves whether the stripes and badges of a cheerleading outfit can be protected by copyright.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.640
One involves alleged racial bias by a juror in a case in Colorado.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.980
One involves money that the Apple technology won

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.100
in a caseinvolving a patent dispute with the Samsung tech company.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.480
There's a lot for justices to consider in these cases alone,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.920
but it begs the question,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.100
how do they get on a docket in the first place with so many lawsuits playing out across the country?

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.400
[ BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ]

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.760
For the Supreme Court,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.040
the big issue is often what cases they hear as much as how they decide those cases.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.560
The justices get thousands of petitions every year,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.400
asking them to hear cases.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.140
But they only agree to decide about 70 of those cases.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.100
The main reason the justices take a case is what`s known as a split in the circuits.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.060
There are 13 circuit courts of appeals, and sometimes,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.920
two of those circuits address the same issue and come out differently.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200
In almost all those cases,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.580
the Supreme Court agrees to decide the case.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.160
Now, what kind of cases do they take?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.120
The Supreme Court only deals with federal law.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.080
So, they will only decide cases that involve interpreting federal laws or

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.000
cases that involve the U.S. constitution which is the ultimate law of the land.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.180
Sometimes the justices do what's called strategic voting.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.900
They think, you know, I think this lower court decision is wrong.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.940
But if I vote to hear this case, my colleagues will make the law even worse.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.820
So, I'm going to vote to leave the case alone rather than risking a bad Supreme Court decision

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.160
that could last for decades.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.300
We often hear about 5-4 Supreme Court decisions.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.020
But it's always worth remembering

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.720
that it only takes four justices

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.380
to make the most important decision of all, which is to hear the case in the first place.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.620
Farming the wind. America's first offshore wind farm is about to open.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.720
These large turbines will be located about three miles off the coast of Block Island,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.300
which is south of Rhode Island.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.560
The cost to build the project, $300 million.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.220
These turbines are huge, almost 600 feet tall from the bottom to the tip top of the fan blade.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
It took a while for people to get behind this project.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.960
Some fishermen were concerned about the impact on their industry.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.180
The Kennedys, a prominent American political family,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.700
were concerned about how the turbines would look.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.060
You can see some offshore wind farms from the beach.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.920
Most of the world's offshore turbines are in Europe.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.820
Leases for the American ones were issued by the Department of the Interior,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.820
which oversees U.S. land management and conservation.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.560
These turbines will start whirring this month

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.960
and their developer estimates they`ll reduce Block Island's electric rates by 40 percent.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.780
Well, we are five days away from the election that will determine America's next president.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.060
Election Day is Tuesday, November 8th.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.620
And the latest polls suggest it could be a very close race

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.460
between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.540
The CIA world fact book describes America's government type not as a democracy,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.120
but as a federal presidential republic. U.S. voters do not directly choose their leaders.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.360
They choose a group of electors who actually determine the president.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.640
This group is called the Electoral College,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.020
and while you heard it defined and seen the Electoral College map,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.540
how exactly does the system work?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.140
What is the Electoral College?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.980
The Electoral College is not a building or institution,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.260
it's just a name given to a designated group of people who cast each state's official votes for president.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.900
This group is made up of 538 people.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.180
Each state has a different number of electors based on their representatives in Congress.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.820
So, states like California and Texas have more votes than states like North and South Dakota.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.520
The only exception, the District of Columbia,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.280
which has three electors, despite not having any voting members in Congress.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.700
How does it work?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.440
Each party selects their own group of electors

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.780
and state that empowers the electors who represent the candidate who won the most votes.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:56.020
Except Nebraska and Maine forward electors based on a combination of statewide results and districts won.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.940
The candidate who receives at least 270 Electoral College votes becomes the next president.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.020
What if there's a tie?

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.660
If there is a tie or if somebody doesn't get to 270,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.700
the House of Representatives appoint the president and the Senate chooses the vice president.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.960
Why does the system exist?

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.920
In short,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.100
the Electoral College was created as a compromise of a several different proposals by the nation's founders.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.560
Critics say the system allows candidates to become president without necessarily securing a majority of voter support,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.420
which happened in 2000.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.240
Advocates argue, it ensures less populated states aren't completely ignored.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.500
How are these people selected?

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.040
The electors are chosen by their political parties in each state.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.240
The only rule is that they cannot currently hold office.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.660
Can an elector ignore the popular vote?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.440
Yes, it's called faithless elector,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.900
but it's rare and it has never affected the outcome of an election.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.200
Some states require formal pledges,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.020
enforced by fines and possible jail time.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.100
But historically speaking,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.800
members rarely depart from the will of the people.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.460
Students at the University of Oregon had a really cool idea of how to dispose of pumpkins.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.320
Step one, freeze them in liquid nitrogen,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.960
step two, drop 'em from four stories up.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.480
Bam!

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:28.400
The hypothesis was that once these gourds were chilled to a temperature of negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.460
they'd shatter on impact.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.040
Good call, y'all.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.480
Plus, while it may not be pumpkin pie,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.320
pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin spice or pumpkin cookies,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.700
it's clear they had a blast breaking pumpkin glass.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.440
It might put a chill on your bones to have to clean up all that frozen fruit,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.420
but they had a vine time making it,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.780
stem from a really gourd idea, and if it grows on enough people,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.220
it could entertain nitrogenerations.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.520
