00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.600
Hey. It's great to have you watching CNN STUDENT NEWS, as our daily currents coverage resumes today.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.420
I'm Carl Azuz

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.740
First up, late last week, the director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a letter to Congress

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.440
It said the FBI had recently discovered more emails that maybe related to an investigation concerning Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.340
The background:

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.120
while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton used a private email server instead of a government one.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.240
This gave Clinton more control over what emails were shared with the government.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.660
The FBI says her server was less secure than a government one.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.860
Clinton said she never sent or received information that was classified, containing U.S. government secrets.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.700
But in July, FBI Director James Comey said a very small number of her emails were marked as having classified information.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.100
He called Clinton and her colleagues, quote, "extremely careless" in how they handled classified info,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.280
but said the FBI did not find clear evidence that they intended to break the law.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.300
The agency did not recommend criminal charges against Clinton and none were filed,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.120
and Clinton said it was a mistake to use a private server and that she would not do it again.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.000
So, what`s going on now?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060
While investigating a separate case,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.460
the FBI says it found new emails that appeared to be related to the Clinton investigation.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.280
House Speaker Paul Ryan says Clinton betrayed Americans` trust by mishandling highly classified information.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
But Clinton says the FBI has, quote, "no case".

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.780
And her campaign says the agency is breaking its own custom of staying out of election year politics.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.500
The FBI's review of the new emails is not likely to be finished by Election Day next Tuesday.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.400
Up next, the Iraqi-led troops are on the outskirts of Mosul,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.060
two weeks into an operation to retake the city from ISIS terrorists.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.140
The Iraqis have come up against roadblocks, snipers and landmines.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.840
And there are reports that ISIS has taken thousands of civilians,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.240
mostly women and children into the city to use as human shields.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.820
With the fiercest fighting ahead, Arwa Damon gives a sense of what`s happened on the advance.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.780
A sand storm has swept and adding another layer of difficulty

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.200
and challenges to this current push around the town of Gogjali.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.840
This is the closest that Iraqi forces have been to Mosul since ISIS swept through

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.260
and took it over more than two years.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.860
And throughout the course of the day,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.200
they have been coming across artillery fire,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.400
exchanging it, mortar fire, rocket fire and sporadically,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.700
some pretty intense small arms fire exchanges as well.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.000
They don`t know exactly how many ISIS fighters are here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.660
because the commander says ISIS is moving its assets

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.420
between Gogjali and the city of 
Mosul itself.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.380
We are less than a kilometer away from its outskirts.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.680
But what ISIS has been doing and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.500
what we saw them do on this day is seemingly send small groups of fighters

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.300
to try to circle around and attack the more fixed positions that the Iraqis have been setting up.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.440
ISIS does regularly sneak up armed forces and this particularly position

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.480
did not receive any incoming fire all morning,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.500
but then a few rounds came in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.380
and they believe that they spotted just around that hour right there.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.560
A rocket strike was then called in to take out what was believed to be the ISIS fighters positions.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.340
Now, the commander here say that they`re going 
through compared to other areas,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.500
very slowly, very methodically,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.720
and that is mostly because there are around 25,000 civilians believed to still be inside Gogjali,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.480
which makes things like calling in an airstrike or

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.740
using their artillery or rocket fire that much more difficult,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.680
it has to be very precise,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.980
otherwise, they risk causing significant civilian casualties.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.280
Arwa Damon, CNN, Gogjali, Iraq

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.000
But since the late summer,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.840
multiple groups have been involved in protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.940
and several camps have sprung up with demonstrators using tents,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.200
teepees, makeshift shelters and RVs as housing.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.400
Some of the protests have been peaceful.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.260
Some haven't.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.860
Activists, in some cases,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.400
have locked themselves to construction equipment being used to build

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.300
the pipeline or destroyed the equipment altogether.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.540
But many say they`re planning to demonstrate against the pipeline throughout the winter.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.820
This was the calm before 141 people ended up in handcuffs.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.500
Hundreds of people blocking a highway and a piece of land for one cause,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.160
trying to stop the North Dakota Access Pipeline in its tracks.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.460
When they saw this military force coming over here,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.560
it took us back to the days of the cavalry riding in and walking out of village.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.120
Protesters blocked a highway,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480
set up camp in the pipeline's path.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.940
As things got more intense,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.340
cars and a piece of construction equipment went up in flames.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.860
Probably a large number of them, maybe even a majority of them were being peaceful.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.800
However, there's a group within that mix that are not peaceful.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.300
When you're throwing Molotov cocktails on law enforcement officers,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.400
you produce a handgun and fire three rounds at law enforcement officers,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400
nobody would just describe that situation as peaceful.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.500
And police moved in, using pepper spray,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.340
bean bag rounds and ear splitting sirens to push protesters off this particular strip of land.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.020
This is that same encampment that the protesters have been cleared out.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.760
And just across the highway, they wasted no time.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.240
The Dakota Access Pipeline project is in full swing.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.360
The protesters, including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.740
denounced violence, saying they are only trying to protect their way of life,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.000
their sacred sites and their water.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.760
Worried about the potential of pipeline ruptures that could poison their water supply.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.420
This is the only source of water for six reservations.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.320
It`s not only important to the reservations,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.920
but all the farms and ranches and townships and municipalities from here to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.780
But their attempts to stop the project have failed so far.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.180
And police say they are just following the law.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.840
So, the dispute is clearly over the pipeline.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.240
This land right here,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.460
is this considered from the opinion of law enforcement private property here in the North Camp?

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:38.380
Yes, the land behind us here is private property, as far as

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.420
So, not the tribe`s property?

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.800
Absolutely correct.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.560
It's private property behind us.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.760
As far as North Dakota law and any law says,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.320
we're way north of the reservation where we're at right now.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.220
The tribe says a 19th century treaty disputes that and they say the land was stolen from them.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.720
That treaty was broken and therefore we feel that every land sell after that date was unlawful.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.480
At first glance, looks like this kid`s dribbling two giant basketballs.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.380
But a wider camera shot shows you he's just a really young player.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.100
Three years old, his name is Carter.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.780
His parents play, so he`s been around the game his whole life,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.620
and they say he's a triple threat.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.740
He could dribble, pass and yes, shoot.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.480
Probably, it won`t be long this boy of three is sinking three pointers.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.220
His advice, one word: practice.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.360
And it's paying off considering that most three-year-olds are just dribbling food,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.340
making fast breaks on toys, dunking rubber duckies,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.400
doing free throws with their lunch, stealing their parents' keys,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.520
travelling places they shouldn't,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.200
rebounding from short naps and doing full court presses on their baby sitter`s nerves.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.620
For Carter, all of that is child's play.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.600
I'm Carl Azuz, sinking puns once again for CNN STUDENT NEWS.
