00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,460
First up, the Brexit, Britain's exit from the European Union just got more complicated

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,840
Over the summer,

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,080
people in the United Kingdom voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the E.U.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,200
the political and economic association of European countries.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,860
British Prime Minister Theresa May had planned to get that process started early next year.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,220
But yesterday, the high court ruled that the nation's parliament has to vote on the process,

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,660
meaning Prime Minister May will need the approval of British lawmakers first.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,420
The government says that before the Brexit vote,

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,080
British lawmakers had already determined to leave the decision up to British voters.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,340
So, the government plans to appeal the decision.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,760
But even if it`s upheld and stays in place,

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,680
most experts expect that British members of parliament will support the Brexit.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
And giving them a vote means that the prime minister`s plans could be delayed.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,120
Supporters of the high court`s decision hope this will give Britons

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,820
and their lawmakers more say in the nation`s terms for leaving the European Union.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,500
Critics say a majority of British voters already chose to leave,

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,820
they want the government to move forward in honoring that decision.

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,480
OK. Up next, a pipeline that shuttles gasoline to the U.S. Southeast has been shut down.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,220
Gas prices are going up in several states.

25
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,700
Gas shortages are possible in some areas.

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,420
Any if these sound familiar?

27
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,540
The same pipeline was temporarily closed in September,

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,340
causing the same problems.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,860
A leak led to an 11-day shutdown at that time.

30
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,280
Earlier this week,

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,660
a construction crew in Alabama accidentally hit the pipeline with a piece of heavy equipment.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
It caused a massive explosion,

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,340
killing one worker and injuring five others.

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,540
This pipeline, the Colonial Pipeline, is important,

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,880
because it runs from refineries in Houston, Texas, all the way up to terminals in New Jersey.

36
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,460
One oil analyst characterized it as the aorta of East Coast gasoline supplies.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,420
Governors in Alabama, Georgia, governors in Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,060
are taking steps to try to avoid gas shortages and keep prices from shooting up.

39
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,780
The pipeline could reopen this Saturday.

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,400
Hard to think of two folks who are traveling more around the U.S. right now

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,160
than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,000
And it's not just the candidates themselves who are crisscrossing the country.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
They're running mates are campaigning.

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,200
Their spouses, children,

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,880
current and former politicians all trying to get out the vote.

46
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,680
And the money being spent can only be measured in millions.

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,260
between the Clinton and Trump campaigns,

48
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,300
plus the outside groups that support them, $75 million are spent.

49
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,480
But that is just on TV ads and that`s just this week alone.

50
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,980
The big prizes are the battleground states,

51
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,880
with the electoral votes that could turn the tide of the election.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,540
John King has a look at how the Electoral College could play out based on recent polling in several states.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,700
Seven new polls in battleground states today that tell us Donald Trump is in better shape

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,280
but still faces a stiff hill to catch up to Hillary Clinton.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,460
Let's walk through these polls and let`s start with the ones conducted for us here at CNN.

56
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,480
Number one in one of the biggest battleground states of all, Florida,

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
always very close to the American politics,

58
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,460
49 percent for Hillary Clinton, 47 percent for Donald Trump,

59
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,640
a two-point race, but statistically that`s a dead heat and a tie in a state that`s always close to the end.

60
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,380
Let's move up north here to the state of Pennsylvania.

61
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,620
This is a blue state,

62
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,820
a traditional Democratic state for sometime,

63
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,200
Hillary Clinton still leads, but this is somewhat encouraging for Donald Trump,

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,340
only a four-point lead, 48 percent to 44 percent for Hillary Clinton in battleground Pennsylvania,

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,560
a state she needs to hold.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,800
If Trump can get that and its electoral votes, that would be a big deal.

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,260
Let's move west as we go through the rest of our CNN poll,

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,440
in the state of Arizona, where Hillary Clinton campaigns on Wednesday.

69
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
A week or so ago, there were some public polling showing her ahead.

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
Republicans now, though, coming home.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,980
This is a traditional Republican state.

72
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,440
Donald Trump leads 49 percent to 44 percent, as Hillary Clinton campaigns out there,

73
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,780
and runs TV ads as well, trying to change it.

74
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,660
Here's a bit of a surprise:

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,760
Nevada, a big Latino population, critical to both of President Obama's victories.

76
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,020
look at this, in the west, Donald Trump pulling ahead in the state of Nevada,

77
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,820
49 percent to 43 percent.

78
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,640
That`s a pretty big deal, as Donald Trump tries to get the math necessary to win the presidency.

79
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,280
Now, let's move to some other polls as we come back toward the east.

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,900
This one is the state of Wisconsin,

81
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,360
traditionally a Democratic state,

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,620
still a Democratic state if you look at this poll,

83
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,600
not out of reach, a six-point lead,

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
but a six-point lead for Hillary Clinton in the state of Wisconsin.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,420
Donald Trump has been there this week. He wants to keep that one on the map.

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Let's go quickly through a couple of others.

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,820
Ohio, one of the biggest battleground states,

88
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,160
always closely contested.

89
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,080
This one, very good news for Donald Trump.

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,920
Ohio, which has been so critical in our past recent presidential elections,

91
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,300
moving Donald Trump's way,

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,100
a five-point lead for Donald Trump in a state again that he must win

93
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
if he's going to have a shot for the presidency.

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,240
And one more, the state where President Obama campaigned today, Obama won this in 2008,

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,700
lost it in 2012, the hotly contested state of North Carolina,

96
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,500
a very small Clinton lead, 47 percent to 44 percent.

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
So, that's a lot of polling to digest.

98
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,540
Seven battleground states,

99
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,720
let's go to the map that matters most and run it through the process.

100
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,320
This is where we have the race today.

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,800
If Hillary Clinton protects the blue on this map, she`s the next president of the United States.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,780
But let's walk through what we just went through.

103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,640
Donal Trump leading in Nevada, leading in Arizona.

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,540
We don`t have any new Utah polling,

105
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,760
but it's pretty safe assumption if he's gaining ground among Republicans in the west,

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,080
let's for the sense of this hypothetical, give them Utah as well, Donald Trump starting to move.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,520
Again, we just showed you Donald Trump leading in Ohio.

108
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
That moves him into a more competitive position,

109
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,360
but still behind Hillary Clinton.

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,180
If she can stop Donald Trump there,

111
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,980
win either Florida or North Carolina and hold the blues,

112
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,740
she'll be the next president of the United States.

113
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,040
But it is not unreasonable looking at those close races,

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,180
even some Democrats concede Trump could well win Florida,

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,400
Trump could well win North Carolina, look at what that would do.

116
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,680
If Donald Trump continues his momentum in those states,

117
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,060
that would get it to 272 to 264,

118
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,100
meaning to win, Hillary Clinton must defend Pennsylvania,

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,440
must defend Michigan, must defend Wisconsin,

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,640
must keep Donald Trump from turning anything that`s blue on this map red.

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
If he can get that close,

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,560
he's in the hunt.

123
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,040
But he still has some significant challenges most of all in Florida and North Carolina.

124
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,120
These two states, North Carolina and Florida,

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,940
right now, the biggest of the big battlegrounds in this presidential race.

Before the team won the World Series,

they came up with a super official excuse note for anyone who might have missed school,
