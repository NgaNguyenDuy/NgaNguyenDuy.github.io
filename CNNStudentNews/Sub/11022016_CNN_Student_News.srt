00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,600
Hey. It's great to have you watching CNN STUDENT NEWS, as our daily currents coverage resumes today.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm Carl Azuz

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,740
First up, late last week, the director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a letter to Congress

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:34,440
It said the FBI had recently discovered more emails that maybe related to an investigation concerning Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,340
The background:

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,120
while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton used a private email server instead of a government one.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
This gave Clinton more control over what emails were shared with the government.

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,660
The FBI says her server was less secure than a government one.

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,860
Clinton said she never sent or received information that was classified, containing U.S. government secrets.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,700
But in July, FBI Director James Comey said a very small number of her emails were marked as having classified information.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,100
He called Clinton and her colleagues, quote, "extremely careless" in how they handled classified info,

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,280
but said the FBI did not find clear evidence that they intended to break the law.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,300
The agency did not recommend criminal charges against Clinton and none were filed,

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,120
and Clinton said it was a mistake to use a private server and that she would not do it again.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,000
So, what`s going on now?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060
While investigating a separate case,

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,460
the FBI says it found new emails that appeared to be related to the Clinton investigation.

19
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,280
House Speaker Paul Ryan says Clinton betrayed Americans` trust by mishandling highly classified information.

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,860
But Clinton says the FBI has, quote, "no case".

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,780
And her campaign says the agency is breaking its own custom of staying out of election year politics.

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,500
The FBI's review of the new emails is not likely to be finished by Election Day next Tuesday.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Up next, the Iraqi-led troops are on the outskirts of Mosul,

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,060
two weeks into an operation to retake the city from ISIS terrorists.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,140
The Iraqis have come up against roadblocks, snipers and landmines.

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,840
And there are reports that ISIS has taken thousands of civilians,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,240
mostly women and children into the city to use as human shields.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,820
With the fiercest fighting ahead, Arwa Damon gives a sense of what`s happened on the advance.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,780
A sand storm has swept and adding another layer of difficulty

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,200
and challenges to this current push around the town of Gogjali.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
This is the closest that Iraqi forces have been to Mosul since ISIS swept through

32
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
and took it over more than two years.

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,860
And throughout the course of the day,

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,200
they have been coming across artillery fire,

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,400
exchanging it, mortar fire, rocket fire and sporadically,

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,700
some pretty intense small arms fire exchanges as well.

37
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,000
They don`t know exactly how many ISIS fighters are here

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,660
because the commander says ISIS is moving its assets

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,420
between Gogjali and the city of 
Mosul itself.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,380
We are less than a kilometer away from its outskirts.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
But what ISIS has been doing and

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,500
what we saw them do on this day is seemingly send small groups of fighters

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,300
to try to circle around and attack the more fixed positions that the Iraqis have been setting up.

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,440
ISIS does regularly sneak up armed forces and this particularly position

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,480
did not receive any incoming fire all morning,

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,500
but then a few rounds came in

47
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,380
and they believe that they spotted just around that hour right there.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,560
A rocket strike was then called in to take out what was believed to be the ISIS fighters positions.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,340
Now, the commander here say that they`re going 
through compared to other areas,

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,500
very slowly, very methodically,

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:15,720
and that is mostly because there are around 25,000 civilians believed to still be inside Gogjali,

52
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,480
which makes things like calling in an airstrike or

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,740
using their artillery or rocket fire that much more difficult,

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,680
it has to be very precise,

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,980
otherwise, they risk causing significant civilian casualties.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Arwa Damon, CNN, Gogjali, Iraq

57
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,000
But since the late summer,

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
multiple groups have been involved in protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline,

59
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,940
and several camps have sprung up with demonstrators using tents,

60
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,200
teepees, makeshift shelters and RVs as housing.

61
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,400
Some of the protests have been peaceful.

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,260
Some haven't.

63
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,860
Activists, in some cases,

64
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,400
have locked themselves to construction equipment being used to build

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,300
the pipeline or destroyed the equipment altogether.

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,540
But many say they`re planning to demonstrate against the pipeline throughout the winter.

67
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,820
This was the calm before 141 people ended up in handcuffs.

68
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,500
Hundreds of people blocking a highway and a piece of land for one cause,

69
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,160
trying to stop the North Dakota Access Pipeline in its tracks.

70
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,460
When they saw this military force coming over here,

71
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,560
it took us back to the days of the cavalry riding in and walking out of village.

72
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Protesters blocked a highway,

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,480
set up camp in the pipeline's path.

74
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,940
As things got more intense,

75
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,340
cars and a piece of construction equipment went up in flames.

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,860
Probably a large number of them, maybe even a majority of them were being peaceful.

77
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,800
However, there's a group within that mix that are not peaceful.

78
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,300
When you're throwing Molotov cocktails on law enforcement officers,

79
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,400
you produce a handgun and fire three rounds at law enforcement officers,

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
nobody would just describe that situation as peaceful.

81
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,500
And police moved in, using pepper spray,

82
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,340
bean bag rounds and ear splitting sirens to push protesters off this particular strip of land.

83
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,020
This is that same encampment that the protesters have been cleared out.

84
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,760
And just across the highway, they wasted no time.

85
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,240
The Dakota Access Pipeline project is in full swing.

86
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,360
The protesters, including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,

87
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,740
denounced violence, saying they are only trying to protect their way of life,

88
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,000
their sacred sites and their water.

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,760
Worried about the potential of pipeline ruptures that could poison their water supply.

90
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,420
This is the only source of water for six reservations.

91
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,320
It`s not only important to the reservations,

92
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,920
but all the farms and ranches and townships and municipalities from here to the Gulf of Mexico.

93
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,780
But their attempts to stop the project have failed so far.

94
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,180
And police say they are just following the law.

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
So, the dispute is clearly over the pipeline.

96
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
This land right here,

97
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,460
is this considered from the opinion of law enforcement private property here in the North Camp?

98
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:38,380
Yes, the land behind us here is private property, as far as

99
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
So, not the tribe`s property?

100
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,800
Absolutely correct.

101
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,560
It's private property behind us.

102
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,760
As far as North Dakota law and any law says,

103
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,320
we're way north of the reservation where we're at right now.

104
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,220
The tribe says a 19th century treaty disputes that and they say the land was stolen from them.

105
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,720
That treaty was broken and therefore we feel that every land sell after that date was unlawful.

106
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,480
At first glance, looks like this kid`s dribbling two giant basketballs.

107
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,380
But a wider camera shot shows you he's just a really young player.

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
Three years old, his name is Carter.

109
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,780
His parents play, so he`s been around the game his whole life,

110
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,620
and they say he's a triple threat.

111
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,740
He could dribble, pass and yes, shoot.

112
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,480
Probably, it won`t be long this boy of three is sinking three pointers.

113
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,220
His advice, one word: practice.

114
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,360
And it's paying off considering that most three-year-olds are just dribbling food,

115
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,340
making fast breaks on toys, dunking rubber duckies,

116
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,400
doing free throws with their lunch, stealing their parents' keys,

117
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
travelling places they shouldn't,

118
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,200
rebounding from short naps and doing full court presses on their baby sitter`s nerves.

119
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,620
For Carter, all of that is child's play.

120
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,600
I'm Carl Azuz, sinking puns once again for CNN STUDENT NEWS.
